## Question 1: Use-Case Diagram

### Submission Text

**Use-Case Diagram for GymFlow System**

I have created a use-case diagram for the GymFlow gym management system. The diagram includes three main actors (Member, Trainer, Administrator) and 26 use cases covering all system functionality.

**Actors:**
- **Member**: Gym members who view workout plans and register for classes
- **Trainer**: Fitness trainers who create workout plans and manage classes  
- **Administrator**: System administrators who manage users and equipment

**Key Use Cases:**
- Member: Login, View Workout Plan, View Class Schedule, Register for Class, View Attendance History
- Trainer: Login, Create/Assign Workout Plans, Manage Class Sessions, Record Attendance, Import/Export Templates
- Administrator: Login, Manage Users, Manage Equipment, View Reports, Export Data

**Diagram Location:**
The detailed use-case diagram structure and instructions are available in `docs/proposal/USE_CASE_DIAGRAM.md`.

**Diagram Creation:**
I will create the visual diagram using Draw.io (https://app.diagrams.net/) - a free tool that requires no account. The diagram will be exported as PNG/PDF and saved to `docs/architecture-diagrams/use-case-diagram.png`.

**Note**: The visual diagram file will be uploaded separately as an image/PDF attachment.

4. **Faisal** - Testing & Quality Assurance
   - Responsibilities: Unit testing, integration testing, code quality
   - Current Tasks: Test framework setup, writing test suites
   - Progress: 5% complete - Basic test structure in place

5. **Hala** - Documentation & Integration Specialist
   - Responsibilities: Documentation, diagrams, file I/O, proposal writing

**My Assigned Tasks:**
- ✅ Project skeleton setup (completed)
- 🔄 User model hierarchy enhancement (in progress)
- ⏳ Service layer implementation (upcoming)
- ⏳ Authentication system (upcoming)
- ⏳ Exception handling (upcoming)

**My Progress Status:**
- **Completed**: Project structure, Maven configuration, initial model placeholders
- **In Progress**: Enhancing User model hierarchy with proper OOP principles

- Phase 1 (Documentation): 20%
- Phase 2 (Core Classes): 25%
- Phase 3 (Database): 30%
- Phase 4 (JavaFX): 10%
- Remaining phases: 0-5%

**Lucidchart/Draw.io Links for Diagrams:**

We are using Draw.io (https://app.diagrams.net/) - a free, no-account-required tool. All diagrams will be stored in `docs/architecture-diagrams/`:

- Use-Case Diagram: `docs/architecture-diagrams/use-case-diagram.png` (in progress)
- UML Class Diagram: `docs/architecture-diagrams/class-diagram.png` (planned)
- ER Diagram: `docs/architecture-diagrams/er-diagram.png` (planned)
- System Flowchart: `docs/architecture-diagrams/system-flowchart.png` (planned)
- Sequence Diagrams: `docs/architecture-diagrams/sequence-diagrams/` (planned)

**Detailed Project Plan:**
The complete Kanban project plan with all task assignments, progress tracking, and collaboration details is available in `docs/proposal/PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
